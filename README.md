### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

Open the Jupyter Notebook in the starter code folder named part_1_mars_news.ipynb. You will work in this code as you follow the steps below to scrape the Mars News website.
  1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
  2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
  3. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:
     *  Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary. And, give each dictionary two keys: `title` and `preview`. An example is the following:
        ```
        {'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
   'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27." python 
  }
      ```
     *  Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.
     *  Print the list in your notebook.
